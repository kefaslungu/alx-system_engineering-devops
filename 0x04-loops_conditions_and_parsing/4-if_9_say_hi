#/usr/bin/env bash
#This script uses a while loop that runs as long as the value of the `count` variable is less than or equal to 10. The loop starts by initializing the `count` variable to 1 and then, on each iteration, it increases the value of `count` by 1 using the `count=$((count + 1))` command. Inside the loop, the script uses an if-else statement to check the value of `count` variable. If the value of `count` is equal to 9, it will display "Best School" and "Hi" on new line using the `echo` command. If the value of `count` is not equal to 9, it will display "Best School" as usual. The loop runs 10 times, displaying "Best School" 10 times and on the 9th iteration it will display "Best School" and "Hi" on new line.

count=1

while [ $count -le 10 ]
do
  if [ $count -eq 9 ]
  then
    echo "Best School"
    echo "Hi"
  else
    echo "Best School"
  fi
  count=$((count + 1))
done
